This week, I learned a lot about overloading functions and how to create helper functions.
It wasn't like I wasn't using helper functions before, but now I understand the benefits of using them,
and how to use them to work with classes. I feel liberated, free, now that I learned them. This is because
in the DIY portion, it took me 1/3 of the time of the lab because I put all the repetitive logic into helper
functions.

As an example, before this class, I would have written if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100) in every function,
and then set the grade property manually. However, once I wrote this one setGrade() function to set and check,
my work is already almost done! every other function just calleed this one to set and check, and it had a reliable
behaviour.

I learned some cool concepts this class and look forward to the next one.
