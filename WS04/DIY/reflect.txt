Reflection:

One new thing I learned during this assignment was the use of a constructor. It's really interesting because to me, because it seems just like the overload
of any other function. With this, I'm able to control what's being initialized and how. This is really useful for thinking about my different scenerios of
how I want my functions to work if my arguments are different.


I really liked the DIY because unlike some previous assignments, there was a little bit of freedom here. For example, I could think about what member functions
belonged to the class, and how to implement some functions. I wish there was a little more freedom, but it's okay. We get to think about how to do the implementation ourself,
and I think that's the best part about being able to do a project like this.
